# Casio

This is Casio whereon clicking the keys on the keyboard the same sound is played which will be played when anyone plays an actual casio in real life.
It uses screen animation and sound and we have limited the keys till 26 only so that it does not become clumsy.

- Keys to be Played:
    - For White Keys =>  q,w,e,r,t,y,u,i,o,p,\[,\],\ 
    - For Black Keys => `,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
- Project Still in Development
